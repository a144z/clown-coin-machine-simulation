# clown-coin-machine-simulation with AI
This is the clown coin machine ![clown coin machine simulation](images/clown_machine.jpg)

[x] Reward calculation

[ ] AI improvement

[ ] collision simulation

[ ] physical bias factor


Find the correponds state
![explain](images/explaination.png)

Look in solution (current best solution: sheet solution 3)
![The best solution to use](images/solution_3.png)
Solution for {1010000} : 6

*Note that 9 is just claim reward which is the only case with all coins filled

Try to put coin in the corrsponds position
![put coin](images/solution.jpg)

AI could be improve in the future to find best solution including defraction
